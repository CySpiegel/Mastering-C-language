Greetings and Salutations,

This project is mainly being used as a way to hone my skills in the C language in various programming aspects and methodologies. I will be covering the C language from beginning with the basics from hello world, up to more complicated subjects. Throughout my academic studies I have had to cover many programming languages for various classes and projects ranging from C/C++, C#, Swift5, Python 2/3, Prolog, Lisp, x86 and ARM Assembly, R, Java, JavaScript, SQL, HTML/CSS, and React/React Native. While it is good to know many languages I always felt that becoming a Master of a single language would be more beneficial than becoming a Jack of all trades. 

Join me, where getting lost in a programming language is the only true destination.
